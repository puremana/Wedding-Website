# Wedding Website

## Description
https://ollyandmon.co.nz is a website developed for my brothers wedding. It was built without any dependancies using HTML5, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL. The website is also managed through Cloudflare.

RSVP and the Admin Dashboard both generate content and change content using MySQL. Screenshots of this can be found in the below section where I have inserted 50 random names from http://listofrandomnames.com/ as example data.

If you wish to run this website yourself, create an `includes` folder with `db.php` containing your database connection `$conn`.
